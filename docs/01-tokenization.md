# Part 1: Tokenization

LLMs don't see text — they see sequences of integers. A tokenizer converts between the two.

The tokenizer lives in `CharacterTokenizer.cs`. It builds the vocabulary and handles encode/decode. `TextDataset.cs` then reads the dataset, encodes it once, and creates train/validation batches. This part explains how it works so you understand what you're implementing.

## Character-Level Tokenization

We use the simplest possible tokenizer: each unique character gets an ID.

```csharp
var text = File.ReadAllText("data/shakespeare.txt");
var chars = text.Distinct().OrderBy(c => c).ToList();
var vocabSize = chars.Count;  // 65 for Shakespeare

var stoi = chars.Select((c, i) => (c, (long)i))
    .ToDictionary(x => x.c, x => x.Item2);  // char to int
var itos = chars.Select((c, i) => (c, (long)i))
    .ToDictionary(x => x.Item2, x => x.c);  // int to char

long[] encode(string s) => s.Select(c => stoi[c]).ToArray();
string decode(long[] ids) => new string(ids.Select(i => itos[i]).ToArray());
```

```csharp
encode("Hello");  // [20L, 43L, 50L, 50L, 53L]
decode(new[] { 20L, 43L, 50L, 50L, 53L });  // "Hello"
```

That's it. No libraries, no pretrained models. Shakespeare uses 65 unique characters (letters, digits, punctuation, newlines). Each character becomes one token.

This tokenizer is built directly into our data loading — `CharacterTokenizer.FromText()` does exactly this.

## Why Character-Level?

Character-level tokenization works well for small datasets like Shakespeare (~1M characters) because:

- **Tiny vocabulary** (65 tokens) — the model's embedding table and output layer are small
- **Dense statistics** — with only 65² = 4,225 possible bigrams, every bigram appears many times in the data
- **No dependencies** — no external libraries needed

This matters more than you'd expect. GPT-2's tokenizer (BPE, 50,257 tokens) turns Shakespeare into ~338k tokens with ~11,700 unique token types. Most token bigrams appear only once or twice — the data is too sparse for the model to learn sequential patterns. We tested this: with BPE on Shakespeare, training loss gets stuck at ~6.3 (unigram frequency) and never improves. With character-level, it drops to ~1.5.

## The Tradeoff

Character-level doesn't scale to large datasets:

- **Sequences are ~3x longer** than BPE (more compute per sample)
- **The model has to learn spelling from scratch** — it has no concept of "words"
- **It wastes capacity on predictable patterns** — `t-h-e` almost always appears together, but the model must predict each character separately

For large datasets (TinyStories, OpenWebText), you'd switch to **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)** which groups common character sequences into single tokens. GPT-2 uses a BPE tokenizer with 50,257 tokens. You can use it via `tiktoken`:

```python
import tiktoken
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")
tokens = enc.encode("Hello, world!")  # [15496, 11, 995, 0]
text = enc.decode(tokens)             # "Hello, world!"
```

But for this workshop on Shakespeare, character-level is the right choice.

## How It Connects to the Model

The vocabulary size directly determines two things in the model architecture:

1. **The embedding table** — `Embedding(vocab_size, n_embd)` maps each token ID to a learned vector. With vocab_size=65, this is tiny (65 × 384 = 24,960 parameters). With GPT-2's vocab of 50,257, it's 50,257 × 384 = 19.3M parameters — nearly half the model.

2. **The output layer** — `Linear(n_embd, vocab_size)` produces a probability over all possible next tokens. With 65 tokens, the model chooses from 65 options. With 50,257 tokens, it must spread its predictions across 50,257 classes.

## Key Takeaways

- Tokenization converts text ↔ integer sequences
- We use character-level: each unique character gets an ID (`stoi`/`itos` mappings)
- Vocabulary size must match the dataset — 50k vocab on a tiny dataset means most token patterns are too sparse to learn
- Character-level works for small experiments; BPE is needed for large datasets
- The vocab size directly affects model size (embedding table) and training difficulty (output distribution)
